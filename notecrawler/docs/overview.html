<h2>Notable</h2>
<p>Notable is used to take hand written flat text notes and creates a PDF with many features but without requiring the author to know LaTeX.</p>
<p>Notable comes with a very powerful feature that allows you to specify key phrases that Notable will look up on Wikipedia at compile time.
The firt time Notable runs on a document it creates a database of links. It searches the term finds the hyperlink 
to the appropriate page and make an entry in the database. All links are refreshed automatically after 6 months.</p>

<h4>Images</h4>
<p>Notable works by querying Wikipedia for all text that appears with in the special delimiters of '+'. In addition if there is an 
image associated with the article it will be downloaded as well and added to the text automatically. Notable behaves 
in the following ways based finding a request for link ('+')</p>
<ol>
<li>Query Wikipedia with the API described in Widimedia for the requested article.
<li>If there is no associated image, the available link is written to file and results written out to the LinkDictionary.
<li>If there is an associated image, it will be downloaded and inserted into the document after the line that the link appears in.
<li>If the image is deleted from the directory, nothing will happen to the LaTeX document. To fix it 
	delete the link dictionary and a new one will be generated for the document.
</ol>

<p>You can fix spelling mistakes too. I always spell 'the' teh. Just make an entry in the chardict.txt and Notable will
replace all references it finds with the corresponding correction.
</p>

<p>
Notable has a feature that you can set the title and author of your document with the following commands<br/>
<code>
<pre>
AUTHOR:Author Name
TITLE:Title of Document
INCLUDE:tipa
INCLUDE:graphix
</pre>
</code>
These upper case values are pre-processed by Preprocessor so they are ready to be used when the LaTeX document is 
created, and will create a cover page.

<p><b>Note:</b> all commands must appear as the first text on a line.</p>
<p>Also note that there need not be a space between the command and its arguments; in fact fig: requires that there be no space.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the results from Wikipedia try using a different phrase in '+'s, or try your query on the command search window of Wikipedia itself to see why you are not getting the expected results.
