I got tired of notes that made no sense when I studied so I learned LaTeX to format my notes into PDF. But LaTeX's commands are arcane and difficult to remember so I created Notable. It's a Java parser for a simple and easy note taking language, that formats your notes into a LaTeX document and converts it to PDF. Features include automatic search and link of marked terms, automatic download of images if available, timestamped links that are refreshed after they expire so your notes are always up-to-date.
